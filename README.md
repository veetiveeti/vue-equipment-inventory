# Old-School D&D Equipment Inventory

![Work in progress image of the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veetiveeti/vue-equipment-inventory/main/item-inventory-screenshot.png)

First Vue.js project.

Getting familiar with Vue.js by list rendering an array of dungeoneering equipment, and creating interactivity by a simple add functionality. 

Idea is to make it possible to add rendered equipment to Inventory with a button, and calculate total encumbrance with total equipment weight.
