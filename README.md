# Old-School D&D Item Inventory
First Vue.js project.

Getting familiar with Vue.js by list rendering an array of dungeoneering equipment, and creating interactivity by a simple add functionality. 

Idea is to make it possible to add rendered equipment to Inventory with a button, and calculate total encumbrance with total equipment weight.
